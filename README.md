$ whoami

Senior Product Designer operating at the intersection of
AI systems, enterprise UX, and decision intelligence.

I build labor intelligence systems, forecasting platforms,
and agentic overlays that embed directly into workflows —
not dashboards that sit beside them.

→ Proactive AI inside scheduling systems
→ Multi-SKU forecasting (LightGBM, N-BEATS, PatchTST)
→ Explainable ML interfaces for operators
→ Decision-grade UI for real-time systems
→ Design systems for dense, high-velocity surfaces

$ grep -r "principles" .

• Complexity belongs in the system, not the surface.
• AI should lower cognitive load.
• Interfaces are decision engines.
• Real-time systems must communicate uncertainty.
• If it doesn’t scale, it’s decoration.
